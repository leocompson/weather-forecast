There is also a searchbar at the top toolbar to search for a new city. Once a city is found, please click on the - GO - button to search for the specific city. If you want the current city as the default location, please click on the - Set as default - button in the top toolbar. To add a city to the favorites list, please click on the - Add to favorites button. All the favorites items appear in the favorites tab. Within the settings tab, there are several settings to adjust, including temperature unit, decimal point for badge icon text, etc.
